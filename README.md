## A nifty little app that allows you to keep track of your progress with various hobbies and interests.

"Sometimes doing something is great, but doing something well is the greatest confidence."

"Perfect Practice Makes Perfect."

"One step at a time, all the time."

The current plan is to have 4 different apps that will be separated by cards and modules that will have their own routes.

1. Jiu Jitsu Tracker - Jot down new moves, and show them in an easily reviewable format.
2. Salsero Helper - Keep track of Salsa combinations and how individual chunks and steps can be strung together to make a beautiful dance.
3. Guitar Officianado - A practice counter, a scale practice helper, and a song progress keeper.

These are just my main hobbies that I would find helpful to use for this, but this list can grow as I grow in my interests. (And can also shrink as I mature and narrow down what I'm interested in).

Note: I would also like or this to eventually become a progressive web app, or a native app using nativescript.
